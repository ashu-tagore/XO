# XO - Exoplanet Habitability Classifier üåç

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict exoplanet habitability using NASA data.

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and model development
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets  
- `src/`: Reusable Python modules
- `models/`: Trained models and configurations
- `visualizations/`: Generated plots and figures
- `app/`: Streamlit web application

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Start with: `notebooks/01_data_exploration.ipynb`
3. Follow the numbered notebook sequence

## Goal
Identify potentially habitable exoplanets to prioritize space exploration targets.
