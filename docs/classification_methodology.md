# XO Project - Habitability Classification Methodology

## Physics-Based Classification System

### Classification Criteria (10-point scoring system):
1. **Habitable Zone Position** (3 points)
2. **Planetary Size** (2 points) - Earth-like radius
3. **Temperature Range** (2 points) - Liquid water conditions
4. **Earth Similarity Index** (1 point) - Surface ESI > 0.7
5. **Stellar Characteristics** (1 point) - Stable main sequence
6. **Atmospheric Retention** (1 point) - Gravitational retention

### Habitability Classes:
- **Potentially_Habitable**: Meets most habitability criteria
- **Marginal**: Some habitability potential with limitations
- **Challenging**: Significant obstacles to habitability
- **Hostile**: Extremely unlikely to support life

### Dataset Statistics:
- Total planets: 1,729
- Binary positive class: 2 (0.1%)
- Features available: 16
